                    <p>
                        Hello, my name is Meng Yan. I graduated in Winter 2025 with a B.S. in Information Technology from the University of Washington Tacoma.
                        I’m passionate about cybersecurity, network security, and information assurance, and I am actively seeking a role where I can apply and continue growing my skills in these areas.
                        My academic background includes programming in Java and C#, web development, database design and management, systems analysis, threat modeling, and Windows/Linux administration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve developed interactive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and contributed to team-based projects such as a travel agency website,
                        where I was responsible for both technical implementation and client communication. I also served as the primary developer for a student-tutor platform using JavaScript,
                        Node.js, and SQL Server, where I implemented secure login features, access control, and assignment management. Additionally, I’ve configured network environments with routers and
                        switches, participated in CTF competitions, and completed a internship with the U.S. Air Force, gaining hands-on experience in secure workflow design and HIPAA compliance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I value collaboration, adaptability, and continuous learning in every project I undertake.
                        I also look forward to applying my skills in a professional setting where I can both contribute value and continue to grow.
                    </p>

                    <h2>About Myself</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am driven by a genuine interest in technology, a desire to continuously improve, and a strong sense of responsibility in all my tasks.
                        Outside of academic and professional life, I enjoy exploring history, humanities, music, and writing some story—
                        interests that help keep me well-rounded and creative in my approach to problem-solving.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an Asian American, I have a deep understanding of both American and Asian cultures, which enables me to navigate diverse environments, embrace different perspectives, and contribute to a culture of inclusivity and collaboration. 
                        This multicultural experience has helped me gain a broader cultural perspective and develop flexible ways of thinking—skills that enhance my adaptability and effectiveness in diverse teams.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m also highly adaptable and quick to learn in new environments, enabling me to adjust smoothly to changing situations.
