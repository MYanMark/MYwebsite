                    <p>
                        Hello, I’m Meng Yan, currently pursuing my B.S. in Information Technology at the University of Washington,
                        with an expected graduation in March 2025. I am passionate about the field of IT, especially in areas such as network
                        security and information assurance, where I aspire to build a career. My academic journey has equipped me with strong foundational
                        knowledge, with coursework ranging from programming in Java and C# to web design, systems analysis, and threat modeling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through various hands-on experiences, I’ve had the opportunity to independently develop websites using technologies
                        like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and collaborate on projects such as a travel agency website where I played a key role
                        in both technical development and client communication. I also gained experience in network configuration, working with routers,
                        switches, and simulated environments. I thrive in collaborative environments, always seeking to learn from others while contributing
                        my own strengths.

                    <h2>About Myself</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am driven by a genuine interest in technology, a desire to constantly improve, and a strong sense of responsibility
                        in all my tasks. Outside of my academic and professional life, I enjoy exploring various interests such as history,
                        humanities, and music, which help me stay well-rounded and creative in my approach to problem-solving.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have lived in both China and the United States for many years, which has given me a broader perspective and
                        more ideas to tackle various tasks. I am always willing to help others.Whether in personal or professional settings, I am keen to apply my skills to solve problems and support others. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, I also have good adaptability and can cope with various different environments after learning.
