                        This project was part of an internship sponsored by the U.S. Air Force (194th Force Support Squadron) in Fall 2024.
                        Our objective was to improve internal task management and compliance workflows while ensuring security and accessibility.

                    <p class="st1">Checklist System Development:</p>
                    <p>
                        I helped develop a checklist system designed for multiple departments within the Force Support Squadron.
                        Each department was granted access only to its own documents, with access control enforced through role-based restrictions.
                        The checklists were structured according to the Management Internal Control Tool (MITC) format to ensure standardization and consistent compliance across all departments.
                    </p>

                    <p class="st1">Secure Workflow Automation:</p>
                    <p>
                        I helped design and implement a secure workflow tool (Tasker) that enabled users to view, edit, and sign documents
                        without requiring file downloads or uploads. The system was built to comply with HIPAA and CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information) standards,
                        supporting secure access and role-based visibility.
